## Run the container locally with podman

```bash
podman machine init
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Appsilon/experimental-fda-submission-4-podman
cd experimental-fda-submission-4-podman
podman build . --tag experimental-fda-submission-4-podman
podman pod create --publish 8787:8787 pilot-pod
podman run -dt --pod pilot-pod experimental-fda-submission-4-podman:latest
```
